Hello!

I hope you're doing well. I'm Katherine from the CS-Cart Customer Care team.

I'm writing to you to inform you of the results of a free SEO checkup that we carry out for our customers as part of our customer care service. The aim of this analysis was to identify areas for improvement in order to optimise your website for search engine visibility. Here are the key findings and recommendations:

<h2>The website in the search results.</h2>

Your website is already indexed by Google and there are almost 113000 pages in the index. The search results for your store look good.

<h2>Redirecting from 'www' to non-'www' version</h2>

Your website is working on https://shopappy.com domain, but the www-version of it also accessible. Having both versions of your website functioning independently leads to duplicate content issues. Search engines may treat them as separate entities, diluting your website's authority and rankings. Additionally, inconsistent URLs can confuse users and make it difficult to access your site reliably.

To resolve the issue, you need to add redirect from the https://www.shopappy.com to https://shopappy.com. Please consider contacting your hosing support to add such a redirect.

<h2>Sitemap.xml</h2> 

The <b>sitemap.xml</b> file for the store is missing. It's generally recommended to have such a file to speed up the indexation process. You can generate a sitemap.xml file using the built-in <a href="https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/addons/google_sitemap/set_google_sitemap.html">Google Sitemap</a> add-on.  

<h2>Site performance</h2>

I've checked several pages of your store with the PageSpeed Insights tool. The overall scores are quite good. Here are the average results for three different types of pages:

Homepage: Desktop — 93, Mobile — 43
Category page: Desktop — 98, Mobile — 54
Product page: Desktop — 90, Mobile — 33

To reduce homepage and product loading time on mobile devices, you please consider the following options:

<ul>
<li>Decreasing the number of products in the product blocks (those that list several products). This can be done via the setting of the blocks on the corresponding layout page in the Design — Layouts.
</li>

<li>Creating blocks specifically for mobile devices (with the <b>Show on</b> option in the block settings, please see attached <i>2023-05-16_14-01.png</i>). In such blocks, you can use fewer products than in the blocks shown on desktop devices.
</li>

<li>Using images optimized for WEB. There are quite large images, which significantly slow down the page loading. E.g:

https://shopappy.com/images/logos/11/0286-WVIC_Adrienne-Photography-2021-4212_1_.jpg

https://shopappy.com/images/logos/12/Attachment-1_3_.jpeg

https://shopappy.com/images/abt__ut2/banners/all/10/Page_two__1_.png

Consider replacing such images with images optimized for WEB. If you would like to do it automatically, consider using one of the third-party solutions, e.g. this one:

</li>

<li>There are some third-party scripts that slow down the page loading. The scripts are related to the https://www.addthis.com/ service, which seemingly doesn't work anymore. Please consider removing the related scripts from your store.</li>
</ul>

Hope this information will be helpful. Please feel free to contact us if any questions arise.

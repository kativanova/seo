Hello Yaser,

I have conducted an SEO checkup for the following storefronts of your store: www.gstoreq8.com, www.yourstoreq8.com,
www.tnateeshq8.com. The checkup list is based on Google's recommendations published here:

https://developers.google.com/search/docs

Here are the things I've checked:

<ul>
    <li><b>How the website looks in the search results</b>, namely:

        <ul>
            <li>The fact that the storefronts are indexed by Google. All the checked storefronts appear in the search
                results. Here's the number of pages indexed by Google by storefront:

                www.gstoreq8.com - about 24,600 pages
                www.yourstoreq8.com - about 8,000 pages
                www.tnateeshq8.com - 3,000 about pages
            </li>

            <li>The fact that all the storefronts have a favicon - the icon that appears next to the website's title in
                the search results. A missing favicon can be a minor issue, but having one can enhance the site's visual
                appeal and branding.</li>

            <li>Checked that the titles and meta descriptions of the web pages are concise and descriptive, as optimized
                titles and descriptions can improve the site's visibility and click-through rates in search results.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Redirecting from 'www' to non-'www' version</b>. I've checked that all your storefronts properly redirecting from
        non-www version to www versions. This helps avoid duplicate content issues and consolidates the site's
        authority.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Existence of sitemap.xml and robots.txt files</b>. I've checked that your storefronts have a sitemap.xml file, which
        lists all the pages on the site, and a robots.txt file, which instructs search engines on how to crawl and index
        the site's content. These files are essential for search engine visibility and control over crawling behavior.
        I've also checked that the robots.txt file doesn't contain directives that prevent indexation of the storefront
        pages by major search engines.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Results of check-up in Google PageSpeed Insights</b>. I've analyzed the website's performance using Google PageSpeed
        Insights. Several pages of each storefront were checked. Here are the average results:

        https://www.gstoreq8.com/
        Homepage: Desktop - 59, Mobile - 29
        Category page: Desktop - 93, Mobile - 55
        Product page: Desktop - 85, Mobile - 54

        https://www.yourstoreq8.com/
        Homepage: Desktop - 39, Mobile - 30
        Category page: Desktop - 95, Mobile - 44
        Product page: Desktop - 68, Mobile - 86

        https://www.tnateeshq8.com/
        Homepage: Desktop - 83, Mobile - 47
        Category page: Desktop - 93, Mobile - 51
        Product page: Desktop - 86, Mobile - 63

        To improve these results, please consider the following options:

        <ul>
            <li>Decreasing the number of products in the product blocks (those that list several products). This can be
                done via the setting of the blocks on the corresponding layout page in the <b>Design â€” Layouts</b>.
            </li>

            <li>Creating blocks specifically for mobile devices (with the <b>Show on</b> option in the block settings,
                please see attached <i>2023-05-16_14-01.png</i>). In such blocks, you can use fewer products than in the
                blocks shown on desktop devices.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Existence of broken links</b>. I've scanned the website for broken links, as broken links can negatively impact user experience and harm SEO efforts. There is a broken link on one of the category pages:

        https://www.tnateeshq8.com/mobile-and-accessories-ar-2/ipad-cases-and-accessories/

        The <b>iPhone Cases & Protection</b> link
        (https://www.tnateeshq8.com/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=549) doesn't work. Please consider removing or updating it.
    </li>

Hello!

I hope you're doing well. I'm Katherine from the CS-Cart Customer Care team.

I'm writing to you to inform you of the results of a free SEO checkup that we carry out for our customers as part of our customer care service. This analysis is aimed at identifying areas for improvement to optimize your website for search engine visibility. 

<h3>Checklist</h3>

I concentrated on the things that can harm your web-site from being indexed by the search engines. Here are the things I've checked:

<ol>
    <li><b>How the website looks in the search results</b>, namely:

        <ol>
            <li>If the website is indexed by Google;</li>

            <li>If it's got a favicon;</li>

            <li>If the titles and descriptions of the pages are relevant to the web-site content and there are no "odd" results.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>If there are duplicates of the web-site</b>. When your web-site is functioning independently both via <b>www</b> and <b>non-www</b> address, it leads to <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls" target="_blank">duplicate content issues</a>. The same issue can occur with HTTP and HTTPS versions of the store. I check that all the different versions redirect properly to one single HTTPS version.
    </li>

    <li><b>Existence of the robots.txt file and it's contents</b>. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro" target="_blank">robotx.txt</a> file allows you to tell bots that certain parts of your store shouldn't be crawled. Sometimes users block access to the website unintentionally that results in poor search results.</li>

    <li><b>Existence of the sitemap.xml</b>. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview" target="_blank">sitemap.xml</a> file helps search engines to index a website. It's recommended to have such a file to speed up the indexation process.</li>

    <li><b>Performance of the store via Google PageSpeed Insights</b>. The speed of the website <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search" target="_blank">plays a role in ranking</a> as well as in retention of the visitors that coming to the website. That's why I check performance of the most important page types: homepage, category page and product page.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>If there are broken links on the website.</b> Sometimes menus or other part of the website contain links to pages that don't work anymore and return 404 response. It negatively affects user experience, so such links should be <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2005/11/urls-with-http-errors" target="_blank">removed or updated</a>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Key findings and recommendations</h3>

Your website is already indexed by Google and there are 8&nbsp;770 pages in the index. The search results for your website look good. I noticed the following issues that may improve your ranking.

<ol>
    <li><b>The <b>sitemap.xml</b> file for the store is missing</b>. It's generally recommended to have such a file to speed up the indexation process. You can generate a sitemap.xml file using the built-in <a href="https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/addons/google_sitemap/set_google_sitemap.html">Google Sitemap</a> add-on. </li>
    
<li><b>Low scores in the Google PageSpeed Insights</b>, especially for the mobile devices. The tool indicates a number of large-sized images on the homepage and the main menu. Please consider replacing these images with optimized versions.
